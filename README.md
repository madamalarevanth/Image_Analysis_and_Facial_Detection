# Image_Analysis_and_Facial_Detection

this project is based on facial recognition and image analysis using cognitive vision api provided by microsoft on azure cloud services.

you need to create a Azure account which is free and after the signing up

i have created a computer vision app in cognitive services on the azure cloud which is available in the resources

after creating the app i got the api key and api_endpoint_url from the overview of the app and used it for the analysis

with the keys i am calling the api on the image which is present in the web

using the api i got the description tags, meta data of the image and descriptive analytics of the character like male ,age etc.. refer to the images attached
